# IONA-PSX-PCB
This repository contains the EAGLE files for the v1 IONA-PSX Arduino Shield PCB. It's a simple design that shouldn't be too hard to follow.

## Files
- 2-Layer-JLC.cam is the CAM file from JLCPCB for generating correct gerber files from the EAGLE files
- IONA-PSX.brd is the Board design file.
- IONA-PSX.sch is the schematic file.
This uses the SparkFun EAGLE library, as well as the Open Source Hardware logo.
